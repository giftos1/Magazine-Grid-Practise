# Magazine-Grid-Practise
This project from freeCodeCamp helped me practise on how to use grid layouts and the properties associated with it.  
These properties include:
- grid-column
- grid-auto-flow
- grid-auto-columns
- grid-auto-rows
- grid-template-columns
- column-gap
- row-gap
- gap: row gap column gap;
- place-items
- justify-items
- align-items
